# Basketball-themed Login/Registration Site Sample

This is a sample web app that implements *Login*, *Registration* and *Reset Password* pages.
The project uses a simple example REST API (https://github.com/amandaciobanu/assigment-api-1) for all three functions.

# Setup

To run the application clone the source code from `main` branch and then:
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

By default the application connects to the the REST API hosted on Heroku. If you want to run your own instance of the API, change the value of `BASE_API_URL` in the `config.js` file.

Open the application using your browser.

**Enjoy!**
